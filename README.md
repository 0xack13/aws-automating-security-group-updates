# aws-automating-security-group-updates
This repository contains the artifacts that will be part of a blog post that explores the idea of using an AWS Lambda function, in combination with AutoScaling Lifecycle Hooks and a DynamoDB table, to automatically update security groups for a dynamic environment on your behalf, leaving you with automatically scoped down security groups. 

For more information on how this process works, check out the blog post on the AWS Compute Blog!
